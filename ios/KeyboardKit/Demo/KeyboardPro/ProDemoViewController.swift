/**
 This controller is shared between the two Pro-specific demo
 keyboards and will register a Pro license with many locales.

 The keyboard registers a Pro license to unlock all keyboard
 locales, then applies either LTR or RTL locales based on if
 you are using `KeyboardPro` or `KeyboardProRTL`. A keyboard
 can also register RTL in its `Info.plist` file, by toggling
 the `PrefersRightToLeft` extension attribute to `YES`.

 `IMPORTANT!` You may have noticed how the demo project only
 links KeyboardKit Pro to the app target, while it links the
 KeyboardKit base library to every target that uses it. This
 is because KeyboardKit Pro is a binary framework, which has
 to be linked in this way.
