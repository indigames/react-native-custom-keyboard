 This controller inherits ``ProDemoViewController`` which is
 shared between the KeyboardKit Pro-based demo keyboards and
 used to unlock Pro features, like locales, autocomplete etc.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.
