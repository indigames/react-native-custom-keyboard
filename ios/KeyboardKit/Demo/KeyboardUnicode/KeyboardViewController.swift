/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard using a
 unicode-based input set.

 The keyboard doesn't override `viewWillSetupKeyboard` which
 makes it setup a `SystemKeyboard` which then uses the input
 set that is provided by the ``DemoInputSetProvider``.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.
