/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard that is
 using a `SystemKeyboard` to mimic a native English keyboard.

 This keyboard also uses a couple of custom services to show
 you how you can change locale, appearance, autocomplete etc.
 Have a look at the other keyboards for more examples.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.
