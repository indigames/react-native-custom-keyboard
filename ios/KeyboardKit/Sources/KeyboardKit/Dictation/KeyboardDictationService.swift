/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 dictations between a keyboard extension and its parent app.

 Since keyboard extensions can't access the microphone, your
 keyboard extension must open your app, let your app perform
 dictation and write the text to shared state, then pop back
 to your keyboard to handle the result. This protocol can be
 implemented by classes that supports this type of operation.

 Simply call ``startDictationFromKeyboard(with:)`` from your
 keyboard extension to start a dictation operation. When the
 app opens, just add a `.keyboardDictation(...)` to the root
 view of your app to have it perform the dictation operation
 by calling ``performDictationInApp(with:)``, after which it
 will return to the keyboard, where the controller will call
 ``stopDictationInKeyboard()`` to handle the result.

 KeyboardKit does not have a standard service as it does for
 other services. It has a ``DisabledKeyboardDictationService``
 set up as a placeholder until a custom one is registered.

 KeyboardKit Pro unlocks a ``StandardDictationService`` plus
 a ``StandardKeyboardDictationService`` when a valid license
 is registered and sets up the keyboard dictation service as
 the main ``KeyboardInputViewController/dictationService``.
