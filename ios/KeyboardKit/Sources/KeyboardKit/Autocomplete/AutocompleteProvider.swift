/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to give autocomplete suggestions as the user types.

 Simply call ``autocompleteSuggestions(for:completion:)`` to
 get autocomplete suggestions based on the provided text.

 KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard provider as it does for
 other services. It sets up a ``DisabledAutocompleteProvider``
 that serves as a placeholder until a real one is registered.

 KeyboardKit Pro unlocks two autocomplete providers when you
 register a valid license. `StandardAutocompleteProvider` is
 a locale-specific and non-predictive provider that runs all
 operations locally, while the `ExternalAutocompleteProvider`
 can be used to communicate with any external api or service.

 KeyboardKit Pro registers a standard provider instance when
 you register a pro license.
