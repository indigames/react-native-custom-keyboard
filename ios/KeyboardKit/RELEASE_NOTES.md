# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

Non-functional releases, such as KeyboardKit Pro license releases, are not listed here.

## 7.3

This version adds a first PREVIEW of dictation support. It's a very early version that is not yet tested, but your feedback is very important.

This version keeps the experimental flag for the recently introduced autocomplete provider, until the next minor version. Make sure to test it and provide feedback.

This version adds a bunch of new keyboard themes with new style variations. This means that you can easily tweak a theme-specific set of parameters for the various themes.

### üö® Important information

This version introduces breaking changes with reference to "Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches...". In this case, the benefits are massive since it lets us make many more types `Codable` and `Equatable`, which unlocks a bunch of capabilities.

This requires that the types can't contain non-codable types, such as `Image` or `Font`, which requires breaking changes to the current setup. Types that have `Image` properties will instead use raw `Data`, while types that have `Font` properties will use a new `KeyboardFont` property. `KeyboardFont` can be created in the same way as `Font` but if you want to use it with a SwiftUI view modifier, you have to use `.font(font.font)`.

Just reach out if these breaking changes cause problems. 

### ‚ú® New features

* `Dictation` is a new namespace with PREVIEW types that defines how to perform keyboard dictation.
* `KeyboardBackgroundStyle` has a new convenience initializer.
* `KeyboardBackgroundType` has a new `.clear` and `.verticalGradient` type.

## 7.2

This version focuses on making it easier to style keyboards.

This version adds a theme engine to KeyboardKit Pro. The new `KeyboardThemeAppearance` can be used with the new `KeyboardTheme` to style keyboards with themes, which is a lot easier than defining custom appearances.

This version comes with three themes - `.cottonCandy`, `.neonNights` and `.tron`. You can use them in your own keyboads, or tweak them to create your own visual styles. More themes are coming in future versions. 

Due to a bug found in the new autocomplete provider, the old `StandardAutocompleteProvider` will be replaced in the next minor version.

### ‚ú® New features

## 7.1

This version fixes some bugs and makes it even easier to setup KeyboardKit.

KeyboardKit Pro also has a new experimental and much better autocomplete provider that you can toggle on with the `FeatureToggle`:

```swift
FeatureToggle.shared.toggleFeature(.newAutocompleteEngine, .on)
```

Once this has been verified to work better than the current provider, it will replace it and this feature toggle flag will be removed.

Furthermore, the locale context menu has been refactored to work and look a lot better on iOS 16 and macOS 12. This unfortunately required a few breaking api changes, that hopefully will not affect anyone.

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardInputViewController` `setup` uses a view builder instead of a static view.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` now calls `viewWillSetupKeyboard` in `viewWillAppear` instead of `viewDidLoad`.
* `KeyboardRootView` uses a view builder instead of a static view. 

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `iPadKeyboardLayoutProvider` had a line accidentally removed, which caused English layouts to render incorrect. This has been fixed.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` now creates the keyboard view later, which makes it respect the safe areas better in landscape.
* `LocaleContextMenu` now uses the `KeyboardContext` to localize and sort locales. 

### üí• Breaking changes 

* `SpaceLongPressBehavior` cases have been renamed to read better. This should hopefully affect few people.



## 7.0

KeyboardKit 7.0 involves a major rewrite that aims to bring more consistency in naming and structure and to streamline the library to make future development easier. It bumps the platform deployment targets to iOS 14, macOS 11, tvOS 14 and watchOS 7 and removes all previously deprecated code and todos.

### Migrating from KeyboardKit 6

Although KeyboardKit 7.0 aims to introduce as few breaking changes as possible, there are some surface level APIs that will change. Some such changes are the removal of many shared instances and how more dependencies have to be passed in as parameters. If you are using the now removed shared instances, simply inject the instance as initializer or function parameter instead. 

KeyboardKit 7.0 makes the `SystemKeyboard` easier to use, where it now adds an autocomplete toolbar by default to make sure that the callouts has enough space, and to reduce the risk of memory leaks that was previously easy to add by accident when you connected the toolbar to the keyboard input controller's autocomplete function. If your keyboard uses a custom autocomplete toolbar, you must pass in `autocompleteToolbar: none` in the system keyboard initializer.

If you have problems upgrading to `7.0`, first try upgrading to `6.9`. It has a lot of deprecations in place to provide guidance. You may still experience breaking changes after that, but they will be fewer.
