# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

### ‚ú® New Features

* `ActionCalloutContext` has a new, static `shared` property.
* `ActionCalloutContext` has a new `verticalOffset` that can be used to move the callout up and down.
* `AudioFeedbackConfiguration` is now mutable.
* `HapticFeedbackConfiguration` is now mutable.
* `InputCalloutContext` has a new, static `shared` property.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has a new `didMoveToParent` property, which is used to avoid calling `needsInputModeSwitchKey` when it generates a warning.

### üí° Behavior changes

* Autocomplete now only applies autocorrections for pure `space` actions and not character actions with a single space.
* `ActionCallout` uses the new `ActionCalloutContext` `verticalOffset` to offset the callout bubble.
* `ActionCalloutContext` applies a vertical offset to iPad devices, and adjust the demo toolbar to be 50 on iPad as well.
* `StandardKeyboardBehavior` now has a 0.5 double tap threshold instead of 0.2, and also handles caps lock better.
* `StandardKeyboardFeedbackHandler` now triggers the haptic feedback for long press on space, not the `SpaceCursorDragGestureHandler`.
* `SystemKeyboard` initializers now use `nil` as default value for the controller and width, to avoid Swift errors in binary framework builds.

* `UITextDocumentProxy` `isCursorAtNewSentenceWithSpace` has been adjusted to handle non-empty space content.
