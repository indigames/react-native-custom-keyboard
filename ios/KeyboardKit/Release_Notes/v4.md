# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.



## 4.9.3

### ‚ú® New features

* `PreviewKeyboardAppearance` has been made public.



## 4.9.2

This version renames images to avoid preview problems in apps that define the same image names.

### üóë Deprecations

* A bunch of images have been renamed with a `keyboard` name prefix.



## 4.9.1

This version fixes the iOS 15 autorotate bug and adds a property that can suppress the `needsInputModeSwitchKey` warning.

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardInputViewController` has a new `viewWillSetupKeyboard` function that can be overridden to setup the keyboard at the proper time. It's just a convenience function. You can still setup the keyboard whenever you want.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has a new, static `needsInputModeSwitchKeyOverride` that can be set to make all input controllers ignore the real value. This can be useful when you want to create a keyboard preview and don't want all the warnings.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has a new `needsInputModeSwitchKeyOverride` that can be set to make an input controllers ignore the real value. It will default to the static property value.

### üóë Deprecations

* `KeyboardInputViewController` `setup(with:)` stack view variant is deprecated and will be removed in 5.0.



## 4.9.0

This version adds styles, which makes it a lot easier to style system keyboards.

It also exposes more system keyboard views and styles publicly.

Starting with this version, the library will start deprecating stuff that willbe changed in KK 5. The aim is to release several patches to prepare the library for the changes to come through deprecations instead of breaking changes.

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardAppearance` has a new `systemKeyboardButtonStyle` function.
* `NextKeyboardButton` has an iOS 14 exclusive `Color`-based initializer that is now used by `SystemKeyboardButtonContent`
* `SystemKeyboardButtonBody` is a new view that represents the body of a system keyboard button.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonShadow` is a new view that represents the shadow of a system keyboard button.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonStyle` is a new style that can be used to define a system keyboard button style. 
* `SystemKeyboardButtonBorderStyle` is a new style that can be used to define a system keyboard button border.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonShadowStyle` is a new style that can be used to define a system keyboard button shadow.
* `TextInputProxy` now implements `UITextInputTraits` as well.
* `View+systemKeyboardButtonStyle` view extension now taes a style instead of an apperance, action and isPressed bool.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* Thanks to [@ardavank](https://github.com/ardavank), the `EmojisCategoryKeyboardMenu` now uses fixed fonts.
* `SystemKeyboardButtonContent` now applies the appearance text color to the "next keyboard" button (on iOS 14+).

### üóë Deprecations

* `AutocompleteSuggestionProvider` has been renamed to `AutocompleteProvider`.
* `KeyboardAppearance` has deprecated all functions that now can be fetched from the new `systemKeyboardButtonStyle` style.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` `autocompleteSuggestionProvider` has been renamed to `autocompleteProvider`.
* `View+keyboardButtonStyle` has been replaced with `View+systemKeyboardButtonStyle`.

### üí• Breaking changes

* More system keyboard views require an explicit appearance to be injected.
* The `AutocompleteSuggestionProvider` `autocompleteSuggestions` is now escaping.



## 4.8.0

This versions adds new colors, such as the new standard keyboard background colors, which you can use to mimic keyboard backgrounds.

There are other new colors as well, that are used to work around the iOS color scheme bug, described [here](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit/issues/305) and in the docs.

This makes it possible for us to finally workaround the dark mode color bug, and let the system keyboard look as the system keyboard in both dark mode and dark appearance keyboards.  

Finally, the dark appearance colors have been renamed and their old names deprecated.

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardLocale` is now `Codable`.
* `KeyboardColor` has new colors.
* `Color+Keyboard` has new colors.
* `.standardButtonBackgroundForColorSchemeBug` is a new color scheme bug color.
* `.standardDarkButtonBackgroundForColorSchemeBug` is a new color scheme bug color.

### üí° Behavior changes

* The standard keyboard apperance now uses the new color scheme bug colors, which should make the keyboards look more like the standard ones in dark mode and for dark appearance keyboards.
* `CalloutStyle.standard` now uses the look of `systemStyle`, since that IS the standard. The system styles have been deprecated.
* `SystemKeyboard` uses the new standard callout styles.  


### üêõ Bug fixes

* `InputCallout` now applies the provided style's callout text color.
* `SecondaryInputCallout` now uses the provided style's callout text color.
* `View+Button` now applies shadows in a way that doesn't affect the button content.
* `SystemKeyboard` now looks closer to the iOS system keyboards, in both dark mode and dark appearance.

### üóë Deprecations

* Color extensions for the button background colors are now suffixed with `Background`.
* Color extensions for the button tints colors are now suffixed with `Foreground` instead of `Tint`.
* Color extensions with the name `standardDarkAppearance*` have been renamed to `standard*ForDarkAppearance`.
* `CalloutStyle.systemStyle`, `InputCalloutStyle.systemStyle` and `SecondaryInputCalloutStyle.systemStyle` are deprecated. 

### üí• Breaking changes

* `KeyboardColor`'s dark appearance cases have been renamed to keep things tight.
* `SecondaryInputCalloutStyle`'s text color property has been removed. Use the callout style's text color instead.  



## 4.7.2

### üêõ Bug fixes

* Thanks to @AntoineBache, `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` no longer resize if their text content gets to wide. 



## 4.7.1

### ‚ú® New features

* `Color.darkAppearanceStrategy` is a new, temporary property that lets you inject a custom strategy that controls whether or not to apply a dark appearance color scheme to your keyboard. This lets you work around the current color scheme bug that is described in `Color+Button.swift` and override the standard strategy of always applying dark apperance colors when the keyboard context's `colorScheme` is `.dark`.

If you find a way to determine this correctly and to work around the system behavior, please share your findings.



## 4.7

This version makes KeyboardKit compile for Xcode 13.0 beta 3.

From now, all new versions of KeyboardKit will support the latest Xcode version. 

### üí• Breaking changes

* `CGFloat+Keyboard` and `EdgeInsets+Keyboard` now uses the shared vc instead of the shared application. 



## 4.6.4

### ‚ú® New features

* `SystemKeyboardButton` has a new `contentConfig` init param that allows you to modify the button content before wrapping it in a style and applying gestures.

### üí° Behavior changes

* `KeyboardAction.primary` no longer applies autocomplete by default, which solves e.g. autocomplete suggestions being applied in the Safari address bar. 



## 4.6.3

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now accepts a text binding, so that you can access the typed text.

### üí° Behavior changes

* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now share functionality through a new protocol.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* Thanks to @junyng, deleting backwards now works even when `documentContextBeforeInput` is nil.

### üí• Breaking changes

* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now requires a text binding. 



## 4.6.2

### üêõ Bug fixes

This version adjusts the colors that are used for dark keyboard appearance and dark mode keyboards, to make keyboards look better in dark appearance when in light mode. 

The problem is discussed [here](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit/issues/285).

This fix makes the button a little brighter in dark mode, but that's a lot better than having them be a little darker in dark appearance light mode.



## 4.6.1

### üêõ Bug fixes

This version fixes a bug that caused the keyboard type to not change when typing into a `TextInputProxy` text field.   



## 4.6

This version adds features that makes it possible to add text fields and text views to the keyboard extension and automatically redirect keyboard events there instead of using the hosting app.

You can either set `KeyboardInputViewController.shared.textInputProxy` directly, or use the new `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` views that does this automatically.

### ‚ú® New features

* There is a new `Proxy` namespace to which the `UITextDocumentProxy` extensions have been moved.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has a new `textInputProxy` that can be set to redirect the keyboard to that proxy instead of the original `textDocumentProxy`.
* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` are two new views that can be used in keyboard extensions and that will automatically redirect keyboard events to them when they become first responder.
* `TextInputProxy` is a new class that can be used to redirect the keyboard events to any text input.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* This version fixes a gesture bug that caused the space tap action to be triggered even after long pressing and dragging the cursor around.   

### üí• Breaking changes

* `KeyboardInputViewController` `viewWillSyncWithTextDocumentProxy` was not used internally and has been removed. If you override this in your own keyboards, just override `viewWillAppear` instead. 



## 4.5.6

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `ibayramli2001` and `amirshane` have fixed a crash when deleting backwards without any content in the proxy.   



## 4.5.5

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardCasing` has a new `auto` case.

### üí° Behavior changes

* `SystemKeyboardLayoutProvider` uses the new `auto` case for numeric and symbolic keyboard type switches.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* This version fixes a bug that caused numeric and symbolid keyboards to always switch back to lowercased alphabetic keyboards.

### üóë Deprecations

* `BaseKeyboardLayoutProvider` has been renamed to `SystemKeyboardLayoutProvider`.
* `KeyboardCasing.neutral` is deprecated and will be removed. 



## 4.5.4

### ‚ú® New features

* `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` `canHandle` is now `open` instead of `public`.



## 4.5.3

### üí° Behavior changes

* `KeyboardGestures` now use the drag gesture to trigger tap actions instead of a tap gesture. This increases responsiveness and ensures that taps aren't cancelled when you press for too long.
* `KeyboardGestures` now only applies a double tap gesture if a double tap action is provided. 
* The changes above helps reducing the number of active gestures and reduces the overall gesture complexity.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* This version fixes compile errors in Xcode 12.4.

### üóë Deprecations

* `Image.settings` has been renamed to `keyboardSettings`.
* `Image.moveCursorLeft/Right` have been renamed to `keyboardLeft/Right`.

## 4.5.1

This version fixes a bug that caused the secondary actions to not update.



## 4.5

This version adds new locales, external keyboard detection, dynamic type disabling and RTL locale support.

### üåê New locales

* üá´üá∑ French

* `KeyboardAction+standardButtonFont` now returns a `Font` instead of a `UIFont`.
* `KeyboardAction+standardButtonFontWeight` now returns a `Font.Weight` instead of a `UIFont.Weight`.
* `KeyboardAction` `standardButtonImage` - the property is deprecated in favor for the context-based function.
* The old properties are now called `standardButtonUIFont` and `standardButtonUIFontWeight`. 



## 4.4

This version adds new locales as well as features that make it easier to work with layouts and collections.

In this version, you can also identify the active app ID, which makes it possible to adjust the keyboard accordingly.

There are also several tweaks and behavior changes that make system keyboards behave even more native-like.

### üåê New locales

* üá¨üáß English U.K. (GB)
* üá∫üá∏ English U.S. (same keyboard as base English but different region)

### ‚ú® New features

* `CGFloat` has a new `standardKeyboardButtonCornerRadius` property.
* `DeleteBackwardRange` is a new enum can be used when deleting backwards.
* `EnglishKeyboardInputSetProvider` has new currency init params.
* `KeyboardAction.PrimaryType` has new `newLine` case, that can be used to force an arrow for primary buttons.
* `KeyboardBehavior` has a new `backspaceRange` property.
* `KeyboardColor` is a new enum that exposes the raw color resources.
* `KeyboardContext` has a new `activeAppBundleId` property that identifies the currently active app.
* `KeyboardContext` has a new `screenOrientation` property that replaces `deviceOrientation`.
* `KeyboardPreviewMode` is a new (hopefully temporary) class that has a static `enable()` function that makes SwiftUI previews work.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` has a new `activeAppBundleId` property that identifies the currently active app.
* `RepeatGestureTimer` has been made public and can be used to inspect how long a repeat gesture has been active.
* `RowItem` is a new protocol that makes it possible to gather row collection functions in one place - `Collection+RowItem`.

* `Collection+RowItem` has new extensions that make it easier to add and remove row items to all collections that contain the new `RowItem` protocol.
* `EdgeInsets+Keyboard` has new context-based extensions.
* `UIInputViewController+Orientation` renames `deviceOrientation` to `screenOrientation`.
* `UITextDocumentProxy+Delete` has a new extension for deleting backwards a certain range.

### üí° Behavior changes

* `KeyboardAction` now implements `RowItem`.
* `iPadKeyboardLayoutProvider` has been adjusted layout buttons closer to native layouts.
* `iPhoneKeyboardLayoutProvider` has been adjusted layout buttons closer to native layouts.
* `KeyboardInput` now implements `RowItem`.
* `KeyboardLayoutItem` now implements `RowItem`.
* `StandardKeyboardBehavior` now only auto-switches keyboard type on `.tap`.
* `UITextDocumentProxy` handles new lines when checking if the cursor is at new sentence.

* Standard font sizes are adjusted to fit the native keyboards better.
* The standard backspace range is now progressive and will increase after backspace has been pressed for a while.

### üóë Deprecations

* `KeyboardContext` `deviceOrientation` has been renamed to `screenOrientation`.
* `UIApplication` `preferredKeyboardInterfaceOrientation` didn't work and will be removed.

* `UIInputViewController` `deviceOrientation` has been renamed to `screenOrientation`.
* `UIInterfaceOrientation` - the device orientation-based init is no longer used and will be removed.

### üí• Breaking changes

* `KeyboardBehavior` has a new `backspaceRange` property that must be implemented. 

Besides the points above, `KeyboardActionHandler` had a convenience `handle` function that didn't require a `sender`.  This caused a conflict with the `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` function with the same signature.  Subclassing `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` and calling `super.handle` thus caused a never-ending loop, since the convenience function called the sender function etc. 

The sender-based functions have thus been removed. If you have a custom action handler that overrides `handle` or `canHandle`, you must remove the `sender` parameter.

[Milestone](https://github.com/danielsaidi/KeyboardKit/milestone/16?closed=1).

SwiftUI: Rising. In the shadows no more! 

It's time for `SwiftUI` to rise and become the unrelenting force we always knew it would become. 

`KeyboardKitSwiftUI` has been merged into this repository and the deployment target is raised to `iOS 13`. 

SwiftUI support is a first-class citizen from now on. `UIKit` support is still around, but will no longer be actively developed. The future is a bright, declarative one!

Although these release notes aim at covering everything that has changes in this major version, some things will most probably be missed.

### üí• UIKit changes

In this version, `UIKit` is replaced by `SwiftUI` as the primary layout engine.

As such, to avoid `UIKit` parts blocking SwiftUI, types in the `UIKit` folder will be renamed to start with `UI`:

* `AutocompleteToolbarLabel` -> `UIAutocompleteToolbarLabel`
* `AutocompleteToolbarSeparator` -> `UIAutocompleteToolbarSeparator`
* `AutocompleteToolbarView` -> `UIAutocompleteToolbar` (OBS! Name change as well.)
* `HorizontalKeyboardComponent` -> `UIHorizontalKeyboardComponent`
* `KeyboardAlert` -> `UIKeyboardAlert`
* `KeyboardButton` -> `UIKeyboardButton`
* `KeyboardButtonCollectionView` -> `UIKeyboardButtonCollectionView`
* `KeyboardButtonRowCollectionView` -> `UIKeyboardButtonRowCollectionView`
* `KeyboardButtonView` -> `UIKeyboardButtonView`
* `KeyboardButtonRowComponent` -> `UIKeyboardButtonRowComponent`
* `KeyboardCollectionView` -> `UIKeyboardCollectionView`
* `KeyboardToolbarComponent` -> `UIKeyboardToolbarComponent`
* `KeyboardToolbarView` -> `UIKeyboardToolbarView`
* `KeyboardSpacerView` -> `UIKeyboardSpacerView`
* `KeyboardStackViewComponent` -> `UIKeyboardStackViewComponent`
* `PagedKeyboardComponent` -> `UIPagedKeyboardComponent`
* `RepeatingGestureRecognizer` -> `UIRepeatingGestureRecognizer`
* `Shadow` -> `UIShadow`
* `ToastAlert` -> `UIKeyboardToastAlert` (OBS! Name change as well.)
* `VerticalKeyboardComponent` -> `UIVerticalKeyboardComponent`

Their functionality remains intact, however.

There are a new extension as well, as UIKit support moves away from the core layer:

* `UIView+Keyboard` is now used to apply button gestures to a view, instead of having this functionality in the view controller.
