# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches, though, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

## 5.7

This version adds new locales and improves emoji support.

There are some breaking changes, but they shouldn't affect you if you haven't been customizing emoji keyboards. 

### 🌐 New locales

* 🇧🇾 Belarusian
* 🇨🇿 Czech
* 🇷🇴 Romanian

### ✨ New features

* `Character` has new emoji properties: `isEmoji`, `isCombinedEmoji`, `isSimpleEmoji`.
* `EmojiKeyboardStyle` has renamed and reorganized its parameters.
* `EmojiKeyboardStyle` has a new `verticalKeyboardPadding` property.
* `EmojiKeyboardStyle.standardLargePadLandscape` is now mutable.

* `EmojiKeyboardStyle.standardPhonePortrait` is now mutable.
* `String` has new emoji properties: `containsEmoji`, `containsOnlyEmojis`, `emojis`, `emojiScalars`, `emojiString`, `isSingleEmoji`.

### 💡 Behavior changes

* `EmojiCategoryStyle` is adjusted to be more correct on iPad devices.
* `EmojiCategoryKeyboard.CategoryTitleViewProvider` now takes a style.
* `EmojiCategoryKeyboardTitle` now takes a style, but will default to `.standardPhonePortrait`.
* `KeyboardAction.shift` now uses a lighter color scheme for uppercase.

* Several iPad layouts has adjusted the lower-right keys for numeric keyboards, to have `,` and `.` on the alphabetic keyboard and `!` and `?` on the numeric and symbolic. This is because these symbols currently don't adjust for uppercase and there is no swipe down support.  

### 🐛 Bug fixes

* `EmojiCategory` now adds accidentally excluded 😵‍💫 emoji.

### 🗑 Deprecations

* A bunch of `SystemKeyboardLayoutProvider` `hasXXXAlphabeticInput` properties have been deprecated.

### 💥 Breaking changes

## 5.4.1

This release fixes issues with `EmojiKeyboard` and `EmojiCategoryKeyboard`.

The internal `EmojiKeyboardItem` that created unique IDs caused the emojis to constantly re-render. It has been removed. 

Note that this change now requires emojis to be unique within a certain keyboard.

* `EmojiKeyboard` no longer generates unique IDs for each emoji, which improves performance.
