## About KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit helps you build custom keyboard extensions for iOS and iPadOS, using Swift and SwiftUI. It extends the native keyboard APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality than is otherwise available.

KeyboardKit lets you create keyboards that mimic the native iOS keyboards in a few lines of code. These keyboards can be customized to great extent to change input keys, keyboard layout, design, behavior etc.

</p>

You can also use entirely custom views together with the rich features of KeyboardKit, to create completely custom keyboards. Most of the library can be used on all major Apple platforms.



## Installation

KeyboardKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.git
```

or with CocoaPods:

```
pod KeyboardKit
```

You can add the library to the main app, the keyboard extension and any other targets that need it. If you prefer to not have external dependencies, you can also just copy the source code into your app.



## Supported Platforms

KeyboardKit supports `iOS 14`, `macOS 11`, `tvOS 14` and `watchOS 7`.



## Getting started

The online documentation has a [getting-started guide][Getting-Started] that will help you get started with the library.

To make your custom keyboard extension use KeyboardKit, just install and import KeyboardKit, then  make it inherit `KeyboardInputViewController` instead of `UIInputController`:

```swift
import KeyboardKit

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {}
```

This will by default set up a fully working U.S. English keyboard. You can then override any controller functions to customize how it sets up the keyboard, read and write to its observable states, inject your own services, etc.

For more information, please see the [online documentation][Documentation] and [getting-started guide][Getting-Started].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has articles, code examples etc. that let you overview the various parts of the library and understand how they all connect to each other.

The online documentation is currently iOS-specific. To generate documentation for the other platforms, open the package in Xcode, select a simulator then run `Product/Build Documentation`.

## Demo Application

This project has a `Demo` folder with a demo app that lets you try out KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro. The app has an input text field and shows you how to display the state of a keyboard extension, link to system settings etc.

The demo app has 5 keyboard extensions:

* `English` uses KeyboardKit and has a `SystemKeyboard` with the standard, English locale.
* `Unicode` uses KeyboardKit and has a `SystemKeyboard` with unicode-based input keys.
* `Custom` uses KeyboardKit and has a `SystemKeyboard` with custom keys, layout and appearance.
* `Pro` uses KeyboardKit Pro and has a `SystemKeyboard` with all LRT locales, autocomplete etc.
* `ProRtl` uses KeyboardKit Pro and has a `SystemKeyboard` with all RTL locales, autocomplete etc.

Just open and run the demo app, then enable the keyboards you want to try under System Settings. Note that you need to enable full access to try some features, like audio and haptic feedback.
